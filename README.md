# MRI Image Classification for Alzheimer's Detection

This project uses deep learning to classify MRI brain images for Alzheimer’s detection. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to distinguish healthy brains from those affected by Alzheimer’s, aiming to support early and accurate diagnosis with an automated tool.
